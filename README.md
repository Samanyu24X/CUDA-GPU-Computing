This repository contains projects I worked on while taking CS4990.02 Special Topics: GPU Computing.
In the course, we learned how to leverage the architecture and capabilities of the GPU to execute large operations with increased efficiency.

These projects were developed using the CUDA programming language, and tested remotely using the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications)
